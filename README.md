# mapholder-cad

A Working Repo for my OpenJSCAD projects for personal use with some infastructure to build up and view projects faster. 


##Battlemap

A holder for Chessex Battlemaps build to work with 3M strips for adhesive. Scale is currently off so must be scaled to printer. Use Simplified Model ATM if possible, rest is WIP to format better.
